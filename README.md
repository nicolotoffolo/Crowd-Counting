# Crowd Counting: Comparative Analysis 👥

This project provides a comparative analysis of various crowd counting architectures, exploring deep learning alternatives to the multi-column baseline proposed by **Zhang et al.**

### 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this research is to evaluate model performance in estimating pedestrian density. We focus on addressing common challenges such as scale variation and perspective distortion.

### 📁 What's Inside
- **Complete Source Code:** Implementation of the architectures and training pipelines.
- **Technical Paper:** A detailed report included in the repository that describes the methodology, network structures, and experimental results.
- **Dataset:** All experiments were conducted using the **Mall Dataset**.

### 🛠️ Key Features
- Implementation of [MCNN], [Res-Net18], [SOTA Res-Net18] and [PET Quadtree] as alternatives to Zhang et al.
- Density map generation and visualization.
- Performance evaluation using standard metrics (MAE).

* Mall dataset is required to work with the python notebook provided
